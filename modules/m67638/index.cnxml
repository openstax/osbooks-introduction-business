<para id="fs-idm356303824">Trends in the business and economic environment occur in many areas. As noted earlier, today’s workforce is more diverse than ever, with increasing numbers of minorities and older workers. Competition has intensified. Technology has accelerated the pace of work and the ease with which we communicate. Let’s look at how companies are meeting the challenges of a changing workforce, the growing demand for energy, and how companies are meeting competitive challenges.</para>

<title>Changing Workforce Demographics</title>
<para id="fs-idm353189680">As the baby boomer generation ages, so does the U.S. workforce. In 2010, more than 25 percent of all employees were retirement age. Fast forward to the U.S. labor force in 2017, however, and millennials have taken over the top spot in the labor market, with more than 40 percent of the total workforce. Although older workers are now retiring closer to the traditional retirement age of 65, many plan to keep working beyond 65, often into their 70s. No longer is retirement an all-or-nothing proposition, and older workers in the baby boomer generation are taking a more positive attitude toward their later years. A surprising number of Americans expect to work full- or part-time after “retirement,” and most would probably work longer if phased retirement programs were available at their companies. Financial reasons motivate most of these older workers, who worry that their longer life expectancies will mean outliving the money they saved for retirement, especially after retirement savings took a hit during the global recession of 2007–2009. For others, however, the satisfaction of working and feeling productive is more important than money alone.<cite target-id="rfin-ch01_29"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch01_29">“The Retirement Problem: What Will You Do with All That Time?” <emphasis effect="italics">Knowledge@Wharton,</emphasis> http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu, January 14, 2016.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm352169536">These converging dynamics continue to create several major challenges for companies today. And by 2020, additional generational shifts are projected to occur in the U.S. labor force, which will have an even bigger effect on how companies do business and retain their employees. Today’s workforce spans five generations: recent college graduates (Generation Z); people in their 30s and 40s (millennials and Generation X); baby boomers; and traditionalists (people in their 70s). It is not unusual to find a worker who is 50, 60, or even 70 working for a manager who is not yet 30. People in their 50s and 60s offer their vast experience of “what’s worked in the past,” whereas those in their 20s and 30s tend to be experimental, open to options, and unafraid to take risks. The most effective managers will be the ones who recognize generational differences and use them to the company’s advantage.<cite target-id="rfin-ch01_30"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch01_30">Michael Zimmerman, “Millennials in the Workforce: What They Want, and How to Manage Them,” http://www.smartceo.com, January 11, 2017; Kathy Gurchiek, “What Motivates Your Workers? It Depends on Their Generation,” <emphasis effect="italics">Society for Human Resource Management,</emphasis> http://www.shrm.org, May 9, 2016.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm352169760">Many companies have developed programs such as flexible hours and telecommuting to retain older workers and benefit from their practical knowledge and problem-solving skills. In addition, companies should continually track where employees are in their career life cycles, know when they are approaching retirement age or thinking about retirement, and determine how to replace them and their knowledge and job experiences.<cite target-id="rfin-ch01_31"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch01_31">Tom Anderson, “Employers Offer Older Workers Flexible Retirement,” <emphasis effect="italics">CNBC,</emphasis> http://www.cnbc.com, August 21, 2016.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm356349568">Another factor in the changing workforce is the importance of recognizing diversity among workers of all ages and fostering an inclusive organizational culture. According to a recent report by the <term class="no-emphasis">U.S. Census Bureau</term>, millennials are the largest generation in U.S. history, and more than 44 percent classify themselves as something other than “White.” In addition, women continue to make progress on being promoted to management, although their path to CEO seems to be filled with obstacles. Recent statistics suggest that fewer than 5 percent of Fortune 500 companies have female CEOs. The most successful organizations will be the ones that recognize the importance of diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing corporate strategies.<cite target-id="rfin-ch01_32"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch01_32">Blaze Stutes, “The State of US Workforce Diversity in 14 Statistics,” http://archpointgroup.com, December 1, 2016; Vivian Hunt, Dennis Layton, and Sara Prince, “Why Diversity Matters,” <emphasis effect="italics">McKinsey &amp; Company,</emphasis> http://www.mckinsey.com, January 2015.</note></cite></para>
<note id="bnote-010" class="managing-change"><title>EY Makes Diversity and Inclusion a Top Priority</title><para id="fs-idm369512128">As older workers continue to leave the U.S. labor force and younger individuals begin work or move to other jobs to further their careers, businesses must recognize the importance of diversity and inclusion as key corporate strategies. This is particularly critical as multicultural millennials become the dominant group in the U.S. workforce. One leader in embracing diversity as an important part of corporate life is <term class="no-emphasis">EY</term> (formerly Ernst &amp; Young), a global leader in assurance, tax, and advisory services.</para>
<para id="fs-idm365267088"><term class="no-emphasis">EY</term> believes its core values and business strategies are firmly based on diversity and inclusiveness, as evidenced by the company landing in the top spot of DiversityInc’s 2017 list of the top companies for diversity. This recognition for <term class="no-emphasis">EY</term> is no accident; the company has made diversity and inclusion key goals for its more than 214,000 employees around the world. With a diverse workforce becoming the norm, it is no longer acceptable for companies to simply hold a random seminar or two for their managers and employees to discuss diversity and inclusion in the workplace.</para>
<para id="fs-idm363368896">Karyn Twaronite, <term class="no-emphasis">EY</term>’s global diversity and inclusion officer, believes that a simple, ongoing approach is the most effective way to address diversity and inclusion in the workplace. The company uses a decision-making strategy called PTR, or preference, tradition, and requirement, to help managers think about diversity and inclusion. The strategy challenges managers to examine preferences toward job candidates who are similar to themselves, asks them whether their decision about hiring a specific candidate is influenced by traditional characteristics of a certain role, and urges them to make their selection based on the requirements of the job rather than on their personal preferences. In other words, the decision-making tool gives people a way to question the status quo without accusing colleagues of being biased.</para>
<para id="fs-idm355719616">Another way <term class="no-emphasis">EY</term> fosters inclusiveness is sponsoring professional network groups within the organization. These groups provide members with opportunities to network across various <term class="no-emphasis">EY</term> divisions, create informal mentoring relationships, and strengthen leadership skills. Some of the established networks within <term class="no-emphasis">EY</term> include groups for LGBTQ employees; Black, Latino, and pan-Asian people; women; veterans; and employees with disabilities.</para>
<para id="fs-idm369228016">As a global company that works with clients in many countries, <term class="no-emphasis">EY</term> knows the importance of acknowledging different perspectives and cultures as part of its daily business. The company is committed to making sure employees as well as clients respect different viewpoints and individual differences, including background, education, gender, ethnicity, religious background, sexual orientation, ability, and technical skills. According to <term class="no-emphasis">EY</term>’s diversity web page, research shows that a company’s diverse teams are more likely to improve market share and have success in new markets and that they demonstrate stronger collaboration and better retention.</para>

<title>Global Energy Demands</title>
<para id="fs-idm352578528">As standards of living improve worldwide, the demand for energy continues to rise. Emerging economies such as China and India need energy to grow. Their demands are placing pressure on the world’s supplies and affecting prices, as the laws of supply and demand would predict. For example, in recent years, China and India were responsible for more than half of the growth in oil products consumption worldwide. State-supported energy companies in China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries will place additional competitive pressure on privately owned oil companies such as <term class="no-emphasis">BP</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">Chevron</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">ExxonMobil</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis">Shell</term>.<cite target-id="rfin-ch01_33"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch01_33">Global Energy Statistical Yearbook 2016, “Oil Products Domestic Consumption,” https://yearbook.enerdata.net, accessed May 23, 2017; Joe Carroll, “Big Oil Heads for Back-to-Back Profit Triumphs as Fortunes Turn,” <emphasis effect="italics">Bloomberg Markets,</emphasis> http://www.bloomberg.com, April 28, 2017.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm356019616">Countries worldwide worry about relying too heavily on one source of supply for energy. The United States imports a large percentage of its oil from Canada and Saudi Arabia. Europeans get 39 percent of their natural gas from Russia’s state-controlled gas utility <term class="no-emphasis">OAO Gazprom</term>.<cite target-id="rfin-ch01_34"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch01_34">U.S. Energy Information Administration, “Frequently Asked Questions about Petroleum Imports and Exports,” https://www.eia.gov, accessed May 23, 2017; European Commission, “Energy: Supplier Countries,” https://ec.europa.eu, accessed May 23, 2017.</note></cite> This gives foreign governments the power to use energy as a political tool. For example, continuing tensions between Russia and Ukraine in November 2015 caused Russia to stop sending natural gas to Ukraine, which also causes gas disruptions in Europe because Russia uses Ukraine’s pipelines to transport some of its gas deliveries to European countries. In 2017, Russia announced plans to build its own pipeline alongside Ukraine’s gas line in the Baltic Sea, which would allow Russia to bypass Ukraine’s pipelines altogether and deliver gas directly to European countries.<cite target-id="rfin-ch01_35"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch01_35">Kenneth Rapoza, “Russia’s Gazprom Doubling Down on ‘Anti-Ukraine’ Baltic Pipeline,” <emphasis effect="italics">Forbes,</emphasis> http://www.forbes.com, March 14, 2017; Nataliya Vasilyeva, “Ukraine Stops Buying Russian Gas, Closes Airspace,” <emphasis effect="italics">USA Today,</emphasis> http://www.usatoday.com, November 25, 2015.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm367301776">Countries and companies worldwide are seeking additional sources of supply to prevent being held captive to one supplier. For example, the relatively new technology of extracting oil from shale rock formations in the United States (known as fracking) has help create an important resource for the country’s oil industry. This innovative approach to finding new sources of energy now accounts for more than half of the country’s oil output, which can help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and create new jobs.<cite target-id="rfin-ch01_36"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch01_36">“U.S. Shale Is Turning Up the Heat on OPEC,” http://oilprice.com, May 20, 2017; Matt Egan, “Oil Milestone: Fracking Fuels Half of U.S. Output,” <emphasis effect="italics">CNN Money,</emphasis> http://money.cnn.com, March 24, 2016; Ed Crooks, “The US Shale Revolution,” <emphasis effect="italics">Financial Times,</emphasis> http://www.ft.com, April 24, 2015.</note></cite></para>

<title>Meeting Competitive Challenges</title>
<para id="fs-idm351597824">Companies are turning to many different strategies to remain competitive in the global marketplace. One of the most important is <term>relationship management</term>, which involves building, maintaining, and enhancing interactions with customers and other parties to develop long-term satisfaction through mutually beneficial partnerships. Relationship management includes both <emphasis effect="italics">supply chain management</emphasis>, which builds strong bonds with suppliers, and <emphasis effect="italics">relationship marketing</emphasis>, which focuses on customers. In general, the longer a customer stays with a company, the more that customer is worth. Long-term customers buy more, take less of a company’s time, are less sensitive to price, and bring in new customers. Best of all, they require no acquisition or start-up costs. Good long-standing customers are worth so much that in some industries, reducing customer defections by as little as five points—from, say, 15 percent to 10 percent per year—can double profits.</para>
<para id="fs-idm366525184">Another important way companies stay competitive is through <term>strategic alliances</term> (also called <emphasis effect="italics">strategic partnerships</emphasis>). The trend toward forming these cooperative agreements between business firms is accelerating rapidly, particularly among high-tech firms. These companies have realized that strategic partnerships are more than just important—they are critical. Strategic alliances can take many forms. Some companies enter into strategic alliances with their suppliers, who take over much of their actual production and manufacturing. For example, <term class="no-emphasis">Nike</term>, the largest producer of athletic footwear in the world, does not manufacture a single shoe.</para>
<para id="fs-idm367309536">Other companies with complementary strengths team up. For example, <term class="no-emphasis">Harry’s Shave Club</term>, an online men’s grooming subscription service, recently teamed up with retail giant <term class="no-emphasis">Target</term> to improve sales and boost its brand presence among <term class="no-emphasis">Target</term> shoppers. Harry’s products are now available in <term class="no-emphasis">Target</term>’s brick-and-mortar stores and on <term class="no-emphasis">Target</term>’s website as part of an exclusive deal that makes <term class="no-emphasis">Target</term> the only mass retailer to carry Harry’s grooming products.

<para id="fs-idm366784000">To remain competitive, businesses must identify and respond to trends in the various sectors of the business environment. As the population ages, large numbers of baby boomers are approaching retirement age. Companies must plan for this exodus of employees and find ways to retain the vast amounts of knowledge they represent. Many older workers are choosing to continue working after traditional retirement age, creating a five-generation workforce. Worldwide demand for energy, especially from China and India, is challenging oil companies to increase supplies or to find alternative technologies to produce more oil, such as fracking. U.S. vulnerability to disruptions in energy supply became painfully apparent when Hurricane Katrina put Gulf Coast refineries and offshore drilling rigs out of commission. Companies are using relationship management and strategic alliances to compete effectively in the global economy.</para>

<title>Ethics Activity</title>
<para id="fs-idm327415088">Historically, diesel cars have not been big sellers in the U.S. auto market, mainly because their engines couldn’t pass the strict emissions standards set up by the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board. But that all changed in 2005, when German automaker Volkswagen made a decided push to develop “clean diesel” engines, specifically manufactured to meet strict U.S. emissions standards.</para>
<para id="fs-idm351991504">By 2010, VW had introduced several models of diesel cars in the United States, and their sales helped propel Volkswagen to the number-two slot in global auto sales, after Toyota and ahead of GM. While VW was receiving major media attention for its clean diesel models, researchers from West Virginia University discovered that these so-called clean engines had been constructed with a “defeat device”—software that could actually tell when the car was being tested off road for emissions and lower the level of emissions that harm the environment.</para>
<para id="fs-idm369046368">By December 2014, Volkswagen agreed to voluntarily recall more than a half-million clean diesel cars in the United States to address the emissions issues. But the scandal continued to escalate, with accusations that senior management knew about the rigged engines, and VW’s CEO resigned and several other executives were fired.</para>
<para id="fs-idm357817008">Class-action lawsuits and other litigation followed, and in April 2017, VW agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement, which included a criminal fine of $2.8 billion, as well as various buyback plans for the affected diesel cars.

<para id="fs-idm356383216">As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart has built thousands of brick-and-mortar stores in the United States, Mexico, and elsewhere. Although a success story when it comes to traditional retail locations, Walmart has struggled with its e-commerce efforts, with recent online sales accounting for about 3 percent of the company’s $300 billion in annual sales. The company has tried several different e-commerce strategies in the past, but none of them was an overwhelming success. Some company insiders objected to the pricing strategy used for online purchases; they were fearful that Walmart’s lower prices online would take customers (and sales) away from the retail locations.</para>
<para id="fs-idm365256560">Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO since 2014, believed a significant change was needed in the company’s e-commerce business, and he recently made changes in a big way. Over the past two years, Walmart spent billions to acquire several online companies to expand its e-commerce business in an effort to take a small bite out of retail giant Amazon’s success. In 2016, Walmart purchased Jet.com, an e-commerce site that sells a little bit of everything (books, clothing, electronics, etc.) at discount prices. Once the $3 billion acquisition was completed, Jet’s cofounder and CEO, Marc Lore, who now runs Walmart’s e-commerce platform, worked with McMillon to identify other established online companies to add to their e-commerce portfolio, and add they did.</para>
<para id="fs-idm353648928">First Walmart purchased footwear e-tailer ShoeBuy for $70 million in January 2017. The following month, Walmart bought outdoor specialty retailer Moosejaw for $51 million. Then in March, Walmart paid $75 million for ModCloth, an eclectic shopping site for women’s fashions. Walmart is also said to be in negotiations to buy Bonobos, a hip fashion retailer geared to millennial males.</para>
<para id="fs-idm358227984">Reaction to the acquisitions has been mixed, depending on whom you ask. Retail analysts applaud the company’s radical move, pointing out that several well-known traditional retailers have closed their doors or filed bankruptcy because they failed to take part in the e-commerce revolution. Fashionistas, on the other hand, are lukewarm about the move. However, McMillon’s decision to allow the online retailers to operate independently may help retain loyal customers. The new e-commerce strategy may also lure typical in-store shoppers to take advantage of the expanded offerings available through both Walmart.com and Jet.com.</para>
