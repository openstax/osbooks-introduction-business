<item>Why are mergers and acquisitions important to a company’s overall growth?</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm490877408">A <term id="term-00001">merger</term> occurs when two or more firms combine to form one new company. For example, in 2016, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Johnson Controls</term>, a leading provider of building efficiency solutions, agreed to merge with Ireland’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Tyco International</term>, a leading provider of fire and security solutions, resulting in a company that will be a leader in products, technologies, and integrated solutions for the building and energy sectors. At the time, the merger was valued at $30 billion, with new Johnson Controls PLC to be based in Ireland. As another example, AT&amp;T and Time Warner merged, representing a significant change in the telecommunications landscape. The newly merged company brought together both content and delivery under one umbrella. Mergers such as this one, in a well-established industry, can produce winning results in terms of improved efficiency and cost savings.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_11" id="cite-00001"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_11">Thomas Content, “With acquisition of Tyco, Johnson Controls will become global 'one-stop shop' for building controls,” Journal Sentinel, January 25, 2016, http://archive.jsonline.com, (accessed August 17, 2017); Johnson Control Media Center, http://www.johnsoncontrols.com (accessed August 17, 2017); Brian Steinberg, “AT&amp;T Opens New Advertising Unit in Advance of Time Warner Merger,” <emphasis effect="italics">Variety,</emphasis> August 4, 2017, (August 6, 2017).</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm333934176">In an <term id="term-00008">acquisition</term>, a corporation or investor group finds a target company and negotiates with its board of directors to purchase it. In 2025, T-Mobile acquired U.S. Cellular for over $4 billion. This strategic move by T-Mobile allows the existing U.S. Cellular customers the ability to seamlessly move to T-Mobile. Additionally, for T-Mobile, the acquisition opens up new rural networks to align with their strategic goals.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_12" id="cite-00002"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_12">Kison Patel, "Recent Mergers and Acquisitions, Including the Largest M&amp;A Deals in Previous Years," <emphasis effect="italics">DealRoom</emphasis>, https://dealroom.net, February 19, 2026.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm332342512">Worldwide merger activity was up significantly in 2025 after several years of decline, in part due to stabilizing interest rates and favorable economic conditions. There was a good deal of activity in the tech sector specifically.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_13" id="cite-00003"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_13">"Recent Mergers and Acquisitions 2025: Key Deals and Market Trends," <emphasis effect="italics">Datarooms</emphasis>, https://data-rooms.org, July 1, 2025; Chris Morris, "8 of the Biggest (and Most Interesting) Deals of 2025," <emphasis effect="italics">Inc.</emphasis>, https://www.inc.com, December 28, 2025.</note></cite> We will discuss the increase in international mergers later in this chapter.</para>

<title>Types of Mergers</title>
<para id="fs-idm345026608">The three main types of mergers are horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate. In a <term id="term-00013">horizontal merger</term>, companies at the same stage in the same industry merge to reduce costs, expand product offerings, or reduce competition. Many of the largest mergers are horizontal mergers to achieve economies of scale. Its $1.25 billion acquisition of trucking company <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Overnite</term> allowed <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">UPS</term>, one of the world’s largest shipping carriers, to step up expansion of its heavy freight–delivery business, thus expanding its product offerings.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_14" id="cite-00004"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_14">Harry R. Webber, “UPS to Buy Trucking Company Overnight for $1.25 Billion to Expand Its Freight Business,” <emphasis effect="italics">USA Today</emphasis>, May 17, 2005, p. 6B.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm323445824">In a <term id="term-00016">vertical merger</term>, a company buys a firm in its same industry, often involved in an earlier or later stage of the production or sales process. Buying a supplier of raw materials, a distribution company, or a customer gives the acquiring firm more control. AT&amp;T's deal with Time Warner is an good example. The move enabled Time Warner to have a hand in the distribution of their content through AT&amp;T's networks.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_15" id="cite-00005"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_15">Madhuri Thakur, "Vertical Merger Example," <emphasis effect="italics">EDUCBA</emphasis>, https://www.educba.com, accessed February 24, 2026.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm335519552">A <term id="term-00020">conglomerate merger</term> brings together companies in unrelated businesses to reduce risk. Combining companies whose products have different seasonal patterns or respond differently to business cycles can result in more stable sales. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Philip Morris</term> Company, now called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Altria Group</term>, started out in the tobacco industry but diversified as early as the 1960s with the acquisition of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Miller Brewing Company</term>. It diversified into the food industry with its subsequent purchase of brands including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">General Foods</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Kraft Foods</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Nabisco</term>, among others. Later spinning off many businesses, current product categories include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco such as Copenhagen and Skoal, cigars, e-vapor products such as MarkTen, and wines.</para>
<para id="fs-idm340295072">A specialized, financially motivated type of merger, the <term id="term-00027">leveraged buyout (LBO)</term> became popular in the 1980s but is less common today. LBOs are corporate takeovers financed by large amounts of borrowed money—as much as 90 percent of the purchase price. LBOs can be started by outside investors or the corporation’s management. For example, in the healthcare sector, Athenahealth was purchased by a private equity firm in 2021 for nearly $20 billion in a leveraged buyout.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_16" id="cite-00006"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_16">Banyan Bio Blog, "5 Recent Leveraged Buyout Examples in Healthcare and Lessons Learned," <emphasis effect="italics">Medium</emphasis>, https://medium.com, August 17, 2023.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm344196464">Often a belief that a company is worth more than the value of all its stock is what drives an LBO. They buy the stock and take the company private, expecting to increase cash flow by improving operating efficiency or selling off units for cash to pay off debt. Although some LBOs do improve efficiency, many do not live up to investor expectations or generate enough cash to pay their debt.</para>

<title>Merger Motives</title>
<para id="fs-idm351127520">Although headlines tend to focus on mega-mergers, “merger mania” affects small companies too, and motives for mergers and acquisitions tend to be similar regardless of the company’s size. The goal is often strategic: to improve overall performance of the merged firms through cost savings, elimination of overlapping operations, improved purchasing power, increased market share, or reduced competition. For example, Oracle Corp. acquired Adi Insights in 2022 to expand its software portfolio to include workforce management features such as scheduling and overtime management.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_17" id="cite-00007"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_17">"Oracle and Adi Insights," https://www.oracle.com, accessed February 24, 2026.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm489805328">Company growth, broadening product lines, acquiring technology or management skills, and the ability to quickly acquire new markets are other motives for acquiring a company. As a notable example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">Yahoo</term> Inc.’s $1 billion cash purchase of a 40 percent stake in China’s biggest e-commerce firm, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Alibaba.com</term>, instantly strengthened its ties to an international internet marketplace.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_18" id="cite-00008"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_18">Joe McDonald, “Yahoo Buys Stake in China’s No. 1 Web Shopping Firm,” <emphasis effect="italics">Associated Press, San Diego Union- Tribune,</emphasis> August 12, 2005, p. C1.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm347877360">Purchasing a company can also offer a faster, less risky, less costly option than developing products or markets in-house or expanding internationally. Amazon's strategic purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 was a move to enter the retail grocery sector. In addition to the new product market, this move offers <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Amazon</term> opportunity to sell <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">Amazon</term> tech products in the grocery stores as well as access to an entirely new set of data on consumers.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_19" id="cite-00009"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_19">Greg Petro, “Amazon's Acquisition of Whole Foods Is About Two Things: Data and Product,” <emphasis effect="italics">Forbes,</emphasis> http://www.forbes.com, accessed March 31, 2018; Kate Taylor, “Here Are All the Changes Amazon Is Making to Whole Foods,” <emphasis effect="italics">Business Insider,</emphasis> www.businessinsider.com, March 2, 2018.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm339798992">Another motive for acquisitions is financial restructuring—cutting costs, selling off units, laying off employees, and refinancing the company to increase its value to stockholders. Financially motivated mergers are based not on the potential to achieve economies of scale, but rather on the acquirer’s belief that the target has hidden value to be unlocked through restructuring. Most financially motivated mergers involve larger companies. When Facebook (now Meta) acquired Instagram for $1 billion, Instagram was a newer company that had yet to generate any revenue. Although the company had a strong customer base and a hold on the photo sharing market, they were struggling financially. The acquisition brought Instagram to the forefront, supported by the financial strength of Meta.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_20" id="cite-00010"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_20">Patrick Schnepf, "Top Mergers and Acquisitions Examples: 18 Successful M&amp;A Deals That Changed the Game," <emphasis effect="italics">SmartRoom</emphasis>, https://smartroom.com, July 31, 2025.</note></cite></para>

<title>Emerging Truths</title>
<para id="fs-idm321796256">Along with the technology boom of the late 1990s, merger activity increased. This was in part due to favorable economic conditions and deregulation. Activity was centered on global expansion and mergers in the technology sector. Companies were using their stock, which had been pushed to unrealistically high levels, to buy each other. When the technology bubble burst in 2000, the level of merger activity dropped as well. It fell even further after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. Then massive corporate wrongdoing began to surface. Stocks plummeted in reaction to these events, and merger transactions, which generally track stock market movements, fell as a result.</para>
<para id="fs-idm342504944">Today, merger activity is once again on the rise. Propelled by a solid economy, low interest rates, good credit, rising stock prices, and stockpiles of cash, activity in mergers and acquisitions is expected to be up nearly 25 percent over 2024 globally.<cite target-id="rfin-ch04_21" id="cite-00011"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch04_21">Victor Goldfeld, Benjamin Roth, Mark Stagliano, Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz, "Mergers and Acquisitions — Reviewing 2025 and Looking Ahead to 2026," <emphasis effect="italics">Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance</emphasis>, https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu, December 20, 2025.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm358999600">Size is definitely an advantage when competing in the global marketplace, but bigger does not always mean better in the merger business. Study results show that heady mega-mergers can, in fact, be a bust for investors who own those shares. So companies are wise to consider their options before stuffing their dollars in the biggest merger slot machine they can find. In their eagerness to snare a deal, many buyers pay a premium that wipes out the merger’s entire potential economic gain. Often managers envision grand synergies that prove illusory or unworkable or buy a company that isn’t what it seems—not fully understanding what they are getting.</para>
<para id="fs-idm335792640">Integrating acquisitions is both an art and a science. Acquirers often underestimate the costs and logistical nightmare of consolidating the operations of merged companies with very different cultures. As a result, they may fail to keep key employees aboard, sales forces selling, and customers happy.</para>
<para id="fs-idm312893792">Companies will always continue to seek out acquisition candidates, but the fundamental business case for merging will have to be strong. So what should companies look for to identify mergers with a better-than-even chance of turning out well?</para>
<list id="fs-idm344846496" list-type="bulleted">
<item>A purchase price that is low enough—a 10 percent premium over market as opposed to 50 percent—so the buyer doesn’t need significant creative solutions to make the deal work.</item>
<item>A target that is significantly smaller than the buyer—and in a business the buyer understands. The more “transformational” the deal, such as entering a new business arena, the bigger the risk.</item>
<item>A buyer who pays in cash and not overinflated stock.</item>
<item>Evidence that the deal makes both business and financial sense and isn’t purely the brainchild of an empire-building CEO. Mergers are tough—culturally, commercially, and logistically. The most important quality a company can bring to a merger may be humility.</item>

<item>Why are mergers and acquisitions important to a company’s overall growth?</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm342776128">In a merger, two companies combine to form one company. In an acquisition, one company or investor group buys another. Companies merge for strategic reasons to improve overall performance of the merged firm through cost savings, eliminating overlapping operations, improving purchasing power, increasing market share, or reducing competition. Desired company growth, broadened product lines, and the rapid acquisition of new markets, technology, or management skills are other motives. Another motive for merging is financial restructuring—cutting costs, selling off units, laying off employees, and refinancing the company to increase its value to stockholders.</para>
<para id="fs-idm359726336">There are three types of mergers. In a horizontal merger, companies at the same stage in the same industry combine for more economic power, to diversify, or to win greater market share. A vertical merger involves the acquisition of a firm that serves an earlier or later stage of the production or sales process, such as a supplier or sales outlet. In a conglomerate merger, unrelated businesses come together to reduce risk through diversification.</para>
