<para id="fs-idm173258656">Jeremy Shepherd was working full-time for an airline when, at the age of 22, he wandered into an exotic pearl market in China, searching for a gift for his girlfriend. The strand of pearls he handpicked by instinct was later valued by a jeweler back in the States at 20 times what he paid for it. Jeremy cashed his next paycheck and hurried back to Asia, buying every pearl he could afford. Founded in 1996, his company <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Pearl Paradise</term> was brought online in 2000. Shepherd chose the <term id="term-00002">sole proprietorship</term> form of business organization—a business that is established, owned, operated, and often financed by one person—because it was the easiest to set up. He did not want partners, and low liability exposure made incorporating unnecessary.</para>

<title>Advantages of Sole Proprietorships</title>
<para id="fs-idm173013360">Sole proprietorships have several advantages that make them popular:</para>
<list id="fs-idm194072144" list-type="bulleted">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Easy and inexpensive to form</emphasis>. Sole proprietorships have few legal requirements (local licenses and permits) and are not expensive to form, making them the business organization of choice for many small companies and start-ups.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Profits all go to the owner</emphasis>. The owner of a sole proprietorship obtains the start-up funds and gets all the profits earned by the business. The more efficiently the firm operates, the higher the company’s profitability.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Direct control of the business</emphasis>. All business decisions are made by the sole proprietorship owner without having to consult anyone else.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Freedom from government regulation</emphasis>. Sole proprietorships have more freedom than other forms of business with respect to government controls.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">No special taxation</emphasis>. Sole proprietorships do not pay special franchise or corporate taxes. Profits are taxed as personal income as reported on the owner’s individual tax return.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Ease of dissolution</emphasis>. With no co-owners or partners, the sole proprietor can sell the business or close the doors at any time, making this form of business organization an ideal way to test a new business idea.</item>

<title>Disadvantages of Sole Proprietorships</title>
<para id="fs-idm199023904">Along with the freedom to operate the business as they wish, sole proprietors face several disadvantages:</para>
<list id="fs-idm195355952" list-type="bulleted">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Unlimited liability.</emphasis> From a legal standpoint, the sole proprietor and the company are one and the same, making the business owner personally responsible for all debts the company incurs, even if they exceed the company’s value. The owner may need to sell other personal property—their car, home, or other investments—to satisfy claims against the business.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Difficulty raising capital.</emphasis> Business assets are unprotected against claims of personal creditors, so business lenders view sole proprietorships as high risk due to the owner’s unlimited liability. Owners must often use personal funds—borrowing on credit cards, second-mortgaging their homes, or selling investments—to finance their business. Expansion plans can also be affected by an inability to raise additional funding.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Limited managerial expertise.</emphasis> The success of a sole proprietorship rests solely with the skills and talents of the owner, who must wear many different hats and make all decisions. Owners are often not equally skilled in all areas of running a business. A graphic designer may be a wonderful artist but not know bookkeeping, how to manage production, or how to market their work.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Trouble finding qualified employees.</emphasis> Sole proprietors often cannot offer the same pay, fringe benefits, and advancement as larger companies, making them less attractive to employees seeking the most favorable employment opportunities.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Personal time commitment.</emphasis> Running a sole proprietorship business requires personal sacrifices and a huge time commitment, often dominating the owner’s life with 12-hour workdays and 7-day workweeks.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Unstable business life.</emphasis> The life span of a sole proprietorship can be uncertain. The owner may lose interest, experience ill health, retire, or die. The business will cease to exist unless the owner makes provisions for it to continue operating or puts it up for sale.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Losses are the owner’s responsibility.</emphasis> The sole proprietor is responsible for all losses, although tax laws allow these to be deducted from other personal income.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm207842384">The sole proprietorship may be a suitable choice for a one-person start-up operation with no employees and little risk of liability exposure. For many sole proprietors, however, this is a temporary choice, and as the business grows, the owner may be unable to operate with limited financial and managerial resources. At this point, the owner may decide to take in one or more partners to ensure that the business continues to flourish.</para>

<title>Work-Life Balance Important in Small Business</title>
<para id="fs-idm202337136">Survey data suggest that about half of small business owners are satisfied with how they balance their personal lives and work schedules, with some reporting working twice as much as regular employees. Surveys indicate that over half of small business owners work more than 50 hours per week, with nearly 40 percent working over 60 hours per week.</para>
<para id="fs-idm172794224">Many business owners face stress and mental exhaustion, with financial concerns being top-of-list on stress points. However, being a small business owner puts a person in charge of their destiny, offers freedom, and can be very rewarding. Despite the stress and work hours, many are satisfied with being small business owners in general. Dennis Jacobe, chief economist at Gallup, argues, “People see the benefits more closely tied to them when they’re the owner,” he says. “Working hard and long is a natural aspect of the kind of people willing to start their own business.”</para>
<para id="fs-idm196529872">But if employees have trouble balancing work and life, odds are they will have less confidence in you as a leader. When leaders model work-life balance and implement flexible work options, they create a culture of trust and support. Supported employees are generally more productive and less likely to leave.</para>
<para id="fs-idm200166336">The Society for Human Resource Management’s (SHRM) research also shows work-life balance has a great impact on how employees feel about their leaders. Jennifer Schramm, former manager in SHRM's Workplace/Workforce Trends &amp; Forecasting program, and now a Senior Strategic Policy Advisor at AARP, predicts that as companies try to maximize the productivity of each employee, work-life balance and the resulting employee satisfaction will become increasingly more important. And research shows that happy employees can yield happy returns for businesses.</para>
