<para id="fs-idm200717120">Brothers Fernando and Santiago Aguerre exhibited entrepreneurial tendencies at an early age. At 8 and 9 years old respectively, they sold strawberries and radishes from a vacant lot near their parents’ home in Plata del Mar on the Atlantic coast of Argentina. At 11 and 12, they provided a surfboard repair service from their garage. As teenagers, Fer and Santi, as they call each other, opened Argentina’s first surf shop, which led to their most ambitious entrepreneurial venture of all.</para>
<para id="fs-idm220212096">The flat-footed brothers found that traipsing across hot sand in flip-flops was uncomfortable, so in 1984 they sank their $4,000 savings into manufacturing their own line of beach sandals. Now offering sandals and footwear for women, men, and children, as well as clothing for men, Reef sandals have become the world’s hottest beach footwear, with a presence in nearly every surf shop in the United States.<cite target-id="rfin-ch05_1"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch05_1">Shannon McMahon, “Stepping into a Fortune,” <emphasis effect="italics">San Diego Union-Tribune,</emphasis> April 5, 2005, p.

<title>Young Entrepreneur Living the Dream</title>
<para id="fs-idm213884704">Jack Bonneau is the quintessential entrepreneur. In the three years he has been in business, he has expanded his product line, opened multiple locations, established strategic partnerships, and secured sponsorship from several national brands. His business has garnered publicity from <emphasis effect="italics">The New York Times, The Denver Post, The Today Show</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Good Morning America</emphasis>, and numerous other media. He has shared his business success on several stages, speaking at TechStars and the Aspen Ideas Festival, and recently delivered the closing keynote speech at a national STEM conference. He even landed a gig on <emphasis effect="italics">Shark Tank</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm193477264">Jack Bonneau is smart, charismatic, an excellent spokesperson, and persistent in his mission. And he is only 11 years old—which also makes him very adorable.</para>
<para id="fs-idm199428656">Jack’s business was born from a need that most kids have: a desire for toys. He asked his dad, Steve Bonneau, for a LEGO Star Wars Death Star. The problem was that it cost $400. Jack’s dad said he could have it but only if he paid for it himself. This led Jack to do what a lot of kids do to earn some extra cash. He opened a lemonade stand. But he quickly learned that this would never help him realize his dream, so, with the advice and help of his father, he decided to open a lemonade stand at a local farmers market. “There were lots of people who wanted to buy great lemonade from an eight-year-old,” says Jack. In no time, Jack had earned enough to buy his LEGO Death Star. “I had sales of around $2,000, and my total profit was $900,” Jack said.</para>
<para id="fs-idm213773968">Jack realized that he was on to something. Adults love to buy things from cute kids. What if he could make even more money by opening more locations? Jack developed an expansion plan to open three new “Jack Stands” the following spring. Realizing that he would need more working capital, he secured a $5,000 loan from Young Americas Bank, a bank in Denver that specializes in loans to children. Jack made $25,000 in 2015.</para>
<para id="fs-idm172948688">The following year, Jack wanted to expand operations, so he secured a second loan for $12,000. He opened stands in several more locations, including shopping malls during the holiday season, selling apple cider and hot chocolate instead of lemonade. He also added additional shop space and recruited other young entrepreneurial kids to sell their products in his space, changing the name to Jack’s Stands and Marketplace. One of his first partnerships was Sweet Bee Sisters, a lip balm and lotion company founded by Lily, Chloe, and Sophie Warren. He also worked with 18 other young entrepreneurs who sell a range of products from organic dog treats to scarves and headbands.</para>
<para id="fs-idm183909248">Jack’s strategy worked, and the business brought in more than $100,000 last year. This year, he became the spokesperson for Santa Cruz Organic Lemonade, and he’s now looking at expanding into other cities such as Detroit and New Orleans.</para>
<para id="fs-idm182188720">Even though Jack is only 11 years old, he has already mastered financial literacy, customer service, marketing and sales, social skills, and other sound business practices—all the qualities of a successful entrepreneur.</para>

<title>Entrepreneur or Small-Business Owner?</title>
<para id="fs-idm202163008">The term <emphasis effect="italics">entrepreneur</emphasis> is often used in a broad sense to include most small-business owners. The two groups share some of the same characteristics, and we’ll see that some of the reasons for becoming an entrepreneur or a small-business owner are very similar. But there is a difference between entrepreneurship and small-business management. Entrepreneurship involves taking a risk, either to create a new business or to greatly change the scope and direction of an existing one. Entrepreneurs typically are innovators who start companies to pursue their ideas for a new product or service. They are visionaries who spot trends.</para>
<para id="fs-idm215620720">Although entrepreneurs may be small-business owners, not all small-business owners are entrepreneurs. Small-business owners are managers or people with technical expertise who started a business or bought an existing business and made a conscious decision to stay small. For example, the proprietor of your local independent bookstore is a small-business owner. Jeff <term class="no-emphasis">Bezos</term>, founder of <term class="no-emphasis">Amazon</term>.com, also sells books. But <term class="no-emphasis">Bezos</term> is an entrepreneur: He developed a new model—web-based book retailing—that revolutionized the bookselling world and then moved on to change retailing in general. Entrepreneurs are less likely to accept the status quo, and they generally take a longer-term view than the small-business owner.</para>

<title>Types of Entrepreneurs</title>
<para id="fs-idm188182816">Entrepreneurs fall into several categories: classic entrepreneurs, multipreneurs, and intrapreneurs.</para>
<section id="fs-idm216961584">
<title>Classic Entrepreneurs</title>
<para id="fs-idm220431280"><emphasis effect="italics">Classic entrepreneurs</emphasis> are risk-takers who start their own companies based on innovative ideas. Some classic entrepreneurs are <emphasis effect="italics">micropreneurs</emphasis> who start small and plan to stay small. They often start businesses just for personal satisfaction and the lifestyle. Miho Inagi is a good example of a micropreneur. On a visit to New York with college friends in 1998, Inagi fell in love with the city’s bagels. “I just didn’t think anything like a bagel could taste so good,” she said. Her passion for bagels led the young office assistant to quit her job and pursue her dream of one day opening her own bagel shop in Tokyo. Although her parents tried to talk her out of it, and bagels were virtually unknown in Japan, nothing deterred her. Other trips to New York followed, including an unpaid six-month apprenticeship at Ess-a-Bagel, where Inagi took orders, cleared trays, and swept floors. On weekends, owner Florence Wilpon let her make dough.</para>
<para id="fs-idm213431520">In August 2004, using $20,000 of her own savings and a $30,000 loan from her parents, Inagi finally opened tiny Maruichi Bagel. The timing was fortuitous, as Japan was about to experience a bagel boom. After a slow start, a favorable review on a local bagel website brought customers flocking for what are considered the best bagels in Tokyo. Inagi earns only about $2,300 a month after expenses, the same amount she was making as a company employee. “Before I opened this store I had no goals,” she says, “but now I feel so satisfied.”<cite target-id="rfin-ch05_4"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch05_4">Andrew Morse, “An Entrepreneur Finds Tokyo Shares Her Passion for Bagels,” <emphasis effect="italics">The Wall Street Journal,</emphasis> October 18, 2005, p. B1.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm193475344">In contrast, <emphasis effect="italics">growth-oriented entrepreneurs</emphasis> want their business to grow into a major corporation. Most high-tech companies are formed by growth-oriented entrepreneurs. Jeff Bezos recognized that with Internet technology he could compete with large chains of traditional book retailers. <term class="no-emphasis">Bezos</term>’s goal was to build his company into a high-growth enterprise—and he chose a name that reflected his strategy: Amazon.com. Once his company succeeded in the book sector, Bezos applied his online retailing model to other product lines, from toys and house and garden items to tools, apparel, music, and services. In partnership with other retailers, Bezos is well on his way to making Amazon’s vision “to be Earth’s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.”—a reality.<cite target-id="rfin-ch05_5"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch05_5">Barbara Farfan, “Amazon.com’s Mission Statement”, <emphasis effect="italics">The Balance</emphasis>.

<section id="fs-idm179657344"><title>Multipreneurs</title><para id="fs-idm159718528">Then there are <emphasis effect="italics">multipreneurs,</emphasis> entrepreneurs who start a series of companies. They thrive on the challenge of building a business and watching it grow. In fact, over half of the chief executives at <emphasis effect="italics">Inc.</emphasis> 500 companies say they would start another company if they sold their current one. Brothers Jeff and Rich Sloan are a good example of multipreneurs, having turned numerous improbable ideas into successful companies. Over the past 20-plus years, they have renovated houses, owned a horse breeding and marketing business, invented a device to prevent car batteries from dying, and so on. Their latest venture, a multimedia company called <term class="no-emphasis">StartupNation</term>, helps individuals realize their entrepreneurial dreams. And the brothers know what company they want to start next: yours.<cite target-id="rfin-ch05_6"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rfin-ch05_6">“About StartupNation,” https://startupnation.com, accessed February 1, 2018; Jim Morrison, “Entrepreneurs,” <emphasis effect="italics">American Way Magazine,</emphasis> October 15, 2005, p. 94.</note></cite></para>

<title>Intrapreneurs</title>
<para id="fs-idm195065392">Some entrepreneurs don’t own their own companies but apply their creativity, vision, and risk-taking within a large corporation. Called <term>intrapreneurs</term>, these employees enjoy the freedom to nurture their ideas and develop new products, while their employers provide regular salaries and financial backing. Intrapreneurs have a high degree of autonomy to run their own minicompanies within the larger enterprise. They share many of the same personality traits as classic entrepreneurs, but they take less personal risk. According to Gifford Pinchot, who coined the term <emphasis effect="italics">intrapreneur</emphasis> in his book of the same name, large companies provide seed funds that finance in-house entrepreneurial efforts. These include <term class="no-emphasis">Intel</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">IBM</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">Texas Instruments</term> (a pioneering intrapreneurial company), <term class="no-emphasis">Salesforce.com</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis">Xerox</term>.</para>

<title>Why Become an Entrepreneur?</title>
<para id="fs-idm213194592">As the examples in this chapter show, entrepreneurs are found in all industries and have different motives for starting companies. The most common reason cited by CEOs of the <emphasis effect="italics">Inc.</emphasis> 500, the magazine’s annual list of fastest-growing private companies, is the challenge of building a business, followed by the desire to control their own destiny. Other reasons include financial independence and the frustration of working for someone else.

Do entrepreneurs feel that going into business for themselves was worth it? The answer is a resounding yes. Most say they would do it again.</para>
